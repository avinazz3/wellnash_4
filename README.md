# WellNash

## Introduction
WellNash is an automated workout generator tailored for the Utown gym at the National University of Singapore (NUS). This application customizes workout routines based on workout duration, past performances, injuries, and the gym equipment available.

## Motivation

As undergraduate students at the National University of Singapore (NUS), we have dealt with the constraints imposed by our hectic schedules and the limits of the UTown Gym. Due to responsibilities, the amount of time available for gym use varies greatly each day. Furthermore, the UTown Gym is overcrowded, and equipment is frequently unavailable, resulting in long waits. This makes it difficult for gymgoers to maintain a viable regiment that maximises their benefits.

Recognizing these limitations, we intend to use technology to make the gym experience more accessible, efficient, and personalised for all.

## Aim

Our main goal is to make the gymgoing experience more enjoyable and effective. We will achieve this by automating the process of machine/weight selection and creating personalised workout plans through our intelligent workout plan generator and real-time adaptive workout modifier. This not only enhances the gym experience but also maximises workout effectiveness for individuals. The app keeps track of past performance and future body goals as it suggests the workout in real-time.

Our long-term goal would be to branch out to other gyms besides the UTown gym. This could be achieved by coordinating with major gym franchises (Anytime Fitness, Fitness First etc.) to receive information regarding the types and number of machines across different branches.
